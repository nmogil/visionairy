## ⏳ Future Requirements

### 1. OpenAI API Key (For Feature 3)
**Status**: Not yet needed but will be required for AI image generation

**Action Required**: Add to Convex Dashboard environment variables when implementing Feature 3:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### 2. Clerk Webhook Configuration (Optional but Recommended)
**Status**: Webhook handler is created but webhook endpoint needs to be configured in Clerk Dashboard

**To Configure**:
1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Navigate to Webhooks section
3. Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
4. Select events: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
5. Copy the signing secret and add to `.env.local` as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

**Note**: For development, the webhook works without verification. For production, either install `svix` for proper verification or use the signing secret.

## ✅ Verification Tests Completed

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - ✅ `.env.local` file verified with all required keys
   - ✅ Convex environment variables confirmed

2. **Authentication System**:
   - ✅ Sign-in page accessible at `/sign-in`
   - ✅ Sign-up page accessible at `/sign-up`
   - ✅ Protected routes configured (dashboard, profile, rooms, play)
   - ✅ Webhook handler created for user sync
   - ✅ User sync functions implemented in Convex

3. **Development Commands**:
   - ✅ `npm run dev:frontend` - Next.js server running
   - ✅ `npm run dev:backend` - Convex server running
   - ✅ Both servers tested and operational

## 📋 Ready to Proceed

The project is now fully set up and ready for feature implementation:

1. **Feature 0: Foundation & Core UI System** ✅
   - UI components installed and configured
   - Authentication system fully integrated
   - Dashboard and app layouts created
   - Ready for testing with real user sign-ups

2. **Feature 1: Room Management & Real-time Integration**
   - Can now proceed with room creation and management
   - Real-time subscriptions ready to implement
